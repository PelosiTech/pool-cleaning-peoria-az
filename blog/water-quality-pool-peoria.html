<h1>How Peoria's Water Quality Affects Your Pool</h1>

<p>If you've ever noticed white crusty buildup around your pool tile or struggled to keep water balanced, you're experiencing the effects of Peoria's unique water quality. Understanding how local water conditions impact your pool is the first step to easier, more effective maintenance.</p>

<h2>Understanding Peoria's Water Supply</h2>
<p>Peoria's water comes primarily from a blend of Salt River Project (SRP) surface water and groundwater wells. This mix creates water that's notably hard — typically ranging from 250–400 parts per million (ppm) of calcium hardness. The city's water also contains elevated levels of total dissolved solids (TDS), which directly affects how your pool chemistry behaves. Unlike softer water regions, Peoria pool owners must account for mineral content from the very first fill.</p>

<h2>Calcium Hardness: Peoria's Biggest Challenge</h2>
<p>The high calcium content in Peoria tap water means your pool starts with elevated hardness levels before you add any chemicals. Ideal pool calcium hardness is 200–400 ppm, but fresh Peoria fill water can already be near the top of that range. As water evaporates in our intense desert heat — and it evaporates fast — minerals concentrate further. This leads to calcium scale deposits on tile, equipment, and especially salt cells if you run a saltwater system. Regular acid washing and scale prevention treatments are essential for Peoria pools.</p>

<h2>pH and Alkalinity Fluctuations</h2>
<p>Peoria's water tends to run on the alkaline side, with pH levels often arriving at 7.8–8.2 from the tap. Combined with high alkalinity readings (often 120–180 ppm), this creates a constant battle to keep pH in the ideal 7.4–7.6 range. High pH reduces chlorine effectiveness by up to 50%, meaning your sanitizer works overtime without actually killing bacteria efficiently. Peoria pool owners typically use more muriatic acid than the national average to counteract this alkaline tendency.</p>

<h2>Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Buildup</h2>
<p>Every time water evaporates from your Peoria pool, dissolved minerals stay behind. With evaporation rates exceeding 6 feet per year in our climate, TDS accumulates rapidly. When TDS exceeds 2,000 ppm above your starting fill level, water becomes difficult to balance and may appear cloudy regardless of proper chemical levels. Many Peoria pools require partial draining every 2–3 years to reset TDS levels — a practice less common in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Seasonal Water Quality Changes</h2>
<p>Peoria's water supply composition shifts seasonally. During summer months when demand peaks, the city draws more heavily from groundwater wells, which tend to be harder than surface water. You may notice that your pool requires more acid and scale prevention during summer — it's not just the heat affecting chemistry, it's also the source water changing. During monsoon season, storm runoff can temporarily affect SRP surface water quality, introducing additional minerals and organic compounds.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Pool Equipment</h2>
<p>Peoria's water quality is particularly tough on pool equipment. Salt cells develop scale buildup faster, requiring cleaning every 2–3 months instead of the typical 6-month interval. Pump seals and O-rings degrade faster due to mineral content. Heater heat exchangers are vulnerable to calcium fouling, reducing efficiency and lifespan. Installing a pre-filter or using sequestering agents can significantly extend equipment life for Peoria pool owners.</p>

<h2>Solutions for Peoria Pool Owners</h2>
<p>Managing Peoria's water quality requires a proactive approach: test calcium and TDS levels monthly, use sequestering agents regularly, clean salt cells frequently, and plan for periodic partial drains. Working with a local pool professional who understands Peoria's specific water challenges makes a significant difference in long-term pool health and maintenance costs.</p>
