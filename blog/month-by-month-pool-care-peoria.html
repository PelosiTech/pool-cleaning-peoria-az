<h1>Peoria AZ Pool Care: Month-by-Month Maintenance Guide</h1>

<p>Owning a pool in Peoria, AZ means dealing with extreme temperature swings, intense UV radiation, and mineral-heavy water throughout the year. A month-by-month maintenance plan ensures your pool stays crystal clear and equipment lasts longer. Here's your complete Peoria pool care calendar.</p>

<h2>January &amp; February: Winter Monitoring in Peoria</h2>
<p>Even during Peoria's mild winters, pool care doesn't stop. Water temperatures hover around 55–65°F, which slows algae growth but doesn't eliminate it. Run your pump 4–6 hours daily and test chemistry weekly. Focus on maintaining proper calcium hardness levels — Peoria's hard water can cause scaling if left unchecked. Clean your skimmer baskets and check for debris from winter winds that blow across the desert landscape.</p>

<h2>March &amp; April: Spring Preparation</h2>
<p>As Peoria temperatures climb into the 80s, it's time to ramp up your pool maintenance routine. Increase pump run time to 6–8 hours daily. Perform a thorough brush-down of walls and tile lines where calcium deposits accumulate over winter. This is the ideal time to inspect your pool equipment — check pump seals, filter pressure, and heater connections. Schedule a professional equipment inspection if you notice unusual noises or decreased water flow. Add a phosphate remover to prevent early algae blooms as water warms up.</p>

<h2>May &amp; June: Pre-Summer Deep Clean</h2>
<p>Peoria enters serious heat territory in May, with temperatures regularly exceeding 100°F by June. Your pool becomes the centerpiece of family life. Increase pump run time to 8–10 hours. Test water chemistry twice per week — chlorine demand skyrockets in direct Arizona sun. Backwash or clean your filter more frequently. Check your pool's stabilizer (cyanuric acid) level; it should be 30–50 ppm to protect chlorine from UV degradation. Consider adding a liquid solar cover to reduce evaporation, which can exceed half an inch per day in Peoria summers.</p>

<h2>July &amp; August: Peak Summer &amp; Monsoon Season</h2>
<p>July and August bring Peoria's infamous monsoon storms alongside 110°F+ days. After every dust storm or haboob, you'll need to clean your filter, skim debris, and shock your pool. Monsoon rains dilute chemicals and introduce contaminants — test water immediately after storms. Run your pump 10–12 hours during peak summer. Watch for phosphate spikes from organic debris blown in during storms. Keep extra shock and algaecide on hand for emergency treatments.</p>

<h2>September &amp; October: Fall Transition</h2>
<p>Temperatures begin dropping in Peoria, but September can still hit triple digits. Gradually reduce pump run time as water cools. This is an excellent time for tile cleaning and acid washing if needed. Inspect your pool deck for cracks caused by summer heat expansion. Begin reducing chemical dosages as chlorine demand decreases. October is ideal for any equipment upgrades or repairs before the holiday season.</p>

<h2>November &amp; December: Winter Preparation</h2>
<p>Peoria winters are mild enough that most pools stay operational year-round. Reduce pump run time to 4–6 hours daily. Lower your thermostat if you use a heater, or consider a solar cover to retain warmth. Continue weekly chemical testing and monthly filter cleaning. Trim back any landscaping that drops debris into your pool — Peoria's desert plants shed during fall and winter months.</p>

<h2>Professional Pool Care in Peoria</h2>
<p>Following a month-by-month schedule keeps your Peoria pool in peak condition and prevents costly emergency repairs. Each season brings unique challenges specific to our desert climate, and staying ahead of them saves money and extends equipment life.</p>
